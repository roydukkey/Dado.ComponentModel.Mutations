# Contributions

Contributions are welcome, however it may beneficial to open a discussion about new feature and improvements before beginning development. Pull requests that fix bugs, typos, or improve documentation are generally acceptable without discussion.

## Requirements

Work will only be consider once the follow criteria have been met:

1. Pull requests adhere to current coding style.
2. Pull requests for new features or improvements provide a clear and proven argument of necessity for the changes.
3. Pull requests for new features or improvements provide appropriate unit tests.
4. Pull requests that introduce new `MutationAttributes` should name the new type in a way that indicates an action. For example, for the `ReplaceAttribute` the verb 'replace' is indicating the attribute is going to perform a replacement. Likewise, the `ToUpperAttribute` indicates a typographically case will be forced.
5. Pull requests don't introduce new, unjustified, StyleCop errors or warnings and don't supress StyleCop.
